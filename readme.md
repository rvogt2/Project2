This is a GIF search engine, using JS to populate the page and possesses responsive styling, adjusting to the screen's size.

This can do the following types of queries for GIPHY

- Search - needs a keyword and a limit set. this search option displays multiple GIFs, others display a single GIF
- Random doesn't need any input besides clicking the random button.
- Translate - needs a keyword set.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the GIPHY API
